You must restart your X session before any mouse or graphics changes take 
effect.

You can now run VMware Tools by invoking "/usr/bin/vmware-toolbox-cmd" from the
command line.

To enable advanced X features (e.g., guest resolution fit, drag and drop, and 
file and text copy/paste), you will need to do one (or more) of the following:
1. Manually start /usr/bin/vmware-user
2. Log out and log back into your desktop session; and,
3. Restart your X session.

to use the vmxnet driver, either reboot or
1. stop networking or stop any interface using the vmxnet or pcnet32 driver
2. remove the pcnet32 module with 'rmmod pcnet32'
3. remove the vmxnet module with 'rmmod vmxnet'
4. load the vmxnet module with 'modprobe -v vmxnet'
5. and restart networking or restart the stopped network interfaces
